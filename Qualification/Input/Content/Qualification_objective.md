This qualification report evaluates the developed PBPK drug-drug interactions (DDI) models network for the ability to perform simulations with the intended purpose to predict cytochrome P450 2C19 (**CYP2C19**)-mediated DDI.

To demonstrate the level of confidence, the predictive performance of the platform for this intended purpose is assessed via a network of PBPK models of selected index CYP2C19 DDI perpetrators, and respective sensitive CYP2C19 victim drugs and a comprehensive dataset from published clinical DDI studies. All PBPK models represent whole-body PBPK models, which allow dynamic DDI simulations in organs expressing CYP2C19.

The respective *qualification plan* to produce this *qualification report* is transparently documented and provided open-source (https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSP-Qualification-Reports). The same applies for all presented PBPK models including *evaluation reports* on model building and evaluation of each model (https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSP-PBPK-Model-Library).

*Evaluation reports* including descriptions on model building and detailed evaluations of the included models are documented separately (see [Section 1.2](#12-CYP2C19-DDI-Network)).

Please refer to the [Appendix](#6-Appendix) to learn more details:

- An overview over the Open Systems Pharmacology Suite is given in chapter [Section 6.1](#61-Open-Systems-Pharmacology-Suite-(OSPS)-Introduction)

- [Section 6.2](#62-Mathematical-Implementation-of-Drug-Drug-Interactions) shows the implementation of the underlying mathematical equations for drug-drug interactions in the OSP suite.

- A detailed general description of the performed qualification workflow (*qualification plan*, *qualification report*, etc.) can be found in chapter [Section 6.3](#63-Automatic-(re)-qualification-workflow).
