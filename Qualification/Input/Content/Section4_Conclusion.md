The predicted perpetrator/victim drug concentration-time profiles, DDI AUC and Cmax ratios confirmed that the developed PBPK models are well suited to characterize the CYP2C19 DDI network over the full range of reported DDI studies. Identical Ki values could be used for the moderate CYP2C19 inhibitors and substrates moclobemide (204 μM) and omeprazole (R: 5.3 μM / S: 3.1 μM) in their dynamic DDI interactions. For the strong inhibition of CYP2C19 by fluvoxamine, substrate dependent Ki values were used: 3100 nM and 2.6 nM for Omeprazole and S-mephenytoin, respectively.

**Fluvoxamine** 

- CYP2C19 inhibition:
  - DDI simulations with omeprazole as substrate demonstrate an excellent prediction (ratio pred/obs = around 1) of the inhibitory potential of fluvoxamine on CYP2C19 for both EM and PM for CYP2C19.
  - DDI simulations with s-Mephenytoin as substrate demonstrate an excellent prediction (ratio pred/obs = around 1 and within 2-fold) of the inhibitory potential of fluvoxamine on CYP2C19. However, DDI predictions tend to get slightly overpredicted for higher fluvoxamine doses. 

**Omeprazole**

- Perpetrator:

  - DDI simulations with omeprazole as inhibitor of CYP2C19 demonstrated a good prediction of moclobemide levels (within 2-fold).

- Substrate:

  - DDI simulations with fluvoxamine as inhibitor of omeprazole demonstrated an excellent prediction of omeprazole levels on CYP2C19 for both PM and EM (ratio pred/obs = around 1 and within 2-fold).  Despite some model underprediction in both treatment and control groups, the predicted AUC and Cmax ratios well match the observed ones.
  - DDI simulations with moclobemide as inhibitor of omeprazole demonstrated good prediction of omeprazole levels on CYP2C19. The levels for EM were slightly underpredicted (pred/obs CmaxR = 0.77). Predictions for PM were excellent.

**S-Mephenytoin**

+ Substrate: DDI simulations with S-mephenytoin as a substrate demonstrate an excellent prediction (ratio pred/obs = around 1 and within 2-fold) of the inhibitory potential of fluvoxamine on CYP2C19. However, DDI predictions tend to get slightly overpredicted for Cmax with higher fluvoxamine doses. 

**Moclobemide** 

- Perpetrator: DDI simulations with moclobemide as inhibitor of omeprazole demonstrated good prediction of omeprazole levels for different CYP2C19 phenotypes. The levels for EM were slightly underpredicte. Predictions for PM were excellent.
- Substrate: DDI simulations with omeprazole as inhibitor of moclobemide demonstrated a good prediction of moclobemide levels.
