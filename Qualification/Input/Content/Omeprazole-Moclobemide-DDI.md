The omeprazole-moclobemide interaction was evaluated using clinical DDI studies listed in [Table 2](#Table 2).

**Table 2:**<a name="Table 2"></a> Literature sources of clinical concentration data of omeprazole used for DDI prediction qualification with moclobemide. *-: respective information was not provided in the literature source; \*:single dose unless otherwise specified; EM: extensive metabolizers; PM: poor metabolizers*

A dynamical DDI simulation with moclobemide and omeprazole was conducted and compared to literature data. Both compounds act as CYP2C19 inhibitors and victims. The predefined typical Japanese subject (age = 30 y, weight = 61.87 kg, height = 168.99 cm, BMI = 21.67 kg/m2) was used with CYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 expressions from RT PCR database in PK-Sim and adapted CYP2C19 expression in gut (see evaluation report of omeprazole for more details). Additional enzyme "FMO (other)" was added and expressed in liver only.

In [Cho 2002](#5-References), sixteen volunteers, of whom eight were extensive metabolizers (EM) and eight were poor metabolizers (PM) for CYP2C19, received oral doses of 40 mg omeprazole with or without 300 mg moclobemide co-administration. 

The pharmacokinetic change of omeprazole, omeprazole sulphone and 5-hydroxyomeprazole concentrations were assessed to test for an interaction between omeprazole and moclobemide.
