The S-mephenytoin-fluvoxamine interaction was evaluated using clinical DDI studies listed in [Table 4](#table-4).

A dynamical DDI simulation with fluvoxamine was used to predict the effect of a strong CYP2C19 inhibitor on S-mephenytoin exposure. The predefined “Standard European Male for DDI” individual (age = 30 y, weight = 73 kg, height = 176 cm, BMI = 23.57 kg/m2) with adapted CYP2C19 expression in gut (see evaluation report of omeprazole for more details) was used. Ki value of 2.6 nmol/l for the inhibition of CYP2C19 was selected.

Predictions were compared to clinical results from [Yao 2003](#5-references), where the effect of different fluvoxamine doses in S-Mephenytoin was investigated. 100 mg S-mephenytoin were administered after 7 days of placebo or fluvoxamine treatment (27.5, 45.8, or 64.1 mg).
