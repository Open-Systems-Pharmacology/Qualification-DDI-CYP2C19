The moclobemide-omeprazole interaction was evaluated using clinical DDI studies listed in [Table 5](#Table 5).

A dynamical DDI simulation with moclobemide and omeprazole was conducted and compared to literature data. Both compounds act as CYP2C19 inhibitors and victims. 300 mg moclobemide with or without a single dose of 40 mg omeprazole (racemate, i.e. 20 mg S-omeprazole and 20 mg R-omeprazole) was simulated. The predefined typical Japanese subject (age = 30 y, weight = 61.87 kg, height = 168.99 cm, BMI = 21.67 kg/m2) was used with CYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 expressions from RT PCR database in PK-Sim and adapted CYP2C19 expression in gut (see evaluation report of omeprazole for more details). Additional enzyme "FMO (other)" was added and expressed in liver only.
