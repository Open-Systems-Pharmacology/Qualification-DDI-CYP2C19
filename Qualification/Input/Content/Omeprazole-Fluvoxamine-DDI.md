The omeprazole-fluvoxamine interaction was evaluated using clinical DDI studies listed in [Table 3](#Table 3).

**Table 3:**<a name="Table 3"></a> Literature sources of clinical concentration data of omeprazole used for DDI prediction qualification with fluvoxamine. *\*:single dose unless otherwise specified; hmEM: homozygous extensive metabolizers; PM: poor metabolizers*

A dynamical DDI simulation with fluvoxamine as CYP2C19 inhibitor and omeprazole as victim was conducted and compared to literature data. The predefined typical Japanese subject (age = 30 y, weight = 61.87 kg, height = 168.99 cm, BMI = 21.67 kg/m2) was used with CYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 expression from RT PCR database in PK-Sim and adapted CYP2C19 expression in gut (see evaluation report of omeprazole for more details). Additional enzyme "FMO (other)" was added and expressed in liver only. The Ki value of 3.6 nmol/l for the inhibition of CYP2C19 by fluvoxamine was selected in agreement with literature data ([Iga 2016](#5-References)).

In [Yasui-Furukori 2004](#5-References), eighteen volunteers, of whom six were homozygous extensive metabolizers (hmEMs), six were heterozygous EMs (htEMs) and six were poor metabolizers (PMs) for CYP2C19, received two six-day courses of either daily 50 mg fluvoxamine (split in 25 mg twice daily) or placebo in a randomized fashion with a single oral 40 mg dose of omeprazole on day six in both cases. Plasma concentrations of omeprazole and its metabolites, 5-hydroxyomeprazole, omeprazole sulphone, and fluvoxamine were monitored up to 8 h after the dosing.
